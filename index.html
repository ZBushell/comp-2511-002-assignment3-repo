                    <p>Hi! I'm Zach. It's been way to long for me to have not done this yet, but I finally set up a webpage.</p>
                    <p>
                        This is a small showcase of myself. there are my favorite things, some of my projects, interests of mine, and of-course, my <a class="text-dark" href="#">resume.</a> 
                        I think you'll like what I have to show.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Skiing</h3>
                    <p>
                        First off, let's talk about that banner above. I <strong>LOVE</strong> skiing. Been doing it all my life and even competed in middle/high school. My competetive disciplines were Slalom, Giant Slalom, and Big mountain
                        . I don't compete any more ofcourse and I quit coaching after a year. Nowadays I just ski for fun. If you need a ski buddy for downhil, touring or X-country <a class="text-dark" href="#">Hit me up!</a>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Academic Persuits</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not being a mountain-monkey, I'm a full-time student at <a class="text-dark" target="_blank" href="https://www.mtroyal.ca/">Mount Royal University</a> in Calgary Canada. 
                        I'm currently studying a bachelor's degree of computer information systems and have even managed to make the dean's list a few semesters. I've learned alot (no thanks from the GENED courses)
                        about computers and business in this degree, but I find that some self learning goes a long way instead of just learning through courses. Call it the predilictions of a former Bishop Carrol HS student xD. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mainly the reason why I do University is how much it lets me do with my personal projects. I have 3 that are my obsessions outside of my other obligations. First is my PC. Like vegans
                        (like most vegans) we desktop linux users will shout it from the heavens! I use <a class="text-dark" href="https://nixos.org/" target="_blank">NixOS</a> it's a suuuper cool distro that lets you 
                        reproduce your system configurations based off of one file! know what that means??? Absolutely NO consequences for tinkering! if you pair this with your chosen git remote, you can kiss all those dotfiles
                        goodbye (well not actually but it does cut down the numbers)! As if it wasn't god-tier enough, it now has the calamares installer too. Seriously, try it. Blue screens and broken files will be a thing of the past.
