Ok so I'm going to show you something really neat you can do with your Linux Box that could help you improve your digital security

Some people don't know this but your kernel acutally has a really powerful pseudo-random number generator. 
That can be used for a whole bunch of things, but today we're just going to use it to write some random data to our drive.

So type in this command here and let it run until the terminal gives you an error.

This will take awhile to finish so let me tell you what we're actually doing her and how it improves your digital security.

When a file is deleted it isn't actually deleted. that would take too long for us lazy people to tolerate so we've come up
with a cheat that saves us time.

Instead of being deleted, all that happens is the addres of the file is removed from the drive's table which makes it
inaccessible to the computer. It is only truely delteted when the drive writes new data to the memory addres previously
occupied with the delteted file. 

Te file is still there though and can be retrieved with some difficulty by using specialized recovery software which is what we're
trying to to prevent with this process. 

What the command we're running is doing is writing random zeros and ones to the whole drive that doesn't have a file stored on it.
Overwriting any delteted data and preventing anybody who might have your PC from seeing anything you've delteted.

Pretty neat eh?

Quick note. Still encrypt your drive. Don't go to these lengths if you haven't even done that yet. Like seriously, encrypt your
drive.

Anyways, that's all I really wanted to show you. Bye!
